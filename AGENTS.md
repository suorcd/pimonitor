## Building the pimonitor executable
- Run `cargo build`.  If any warnings or errors are generated, attempt to fix them and rebuild.

## Polling for new/recent feeds
- When polling the podcast index for new/recent feeds, send the `since` url parameter which should contain a unix timestamp of the current time minus 86,400 seconds (24 hours).
- When polling the podcast index for new/recent feeds, send the `max` url parameter with a value of 500.
- Each feed object in the api response `feeds` array/vector contains a `dead` property.  If this property is `true` or `1`, hide the feed from the user interface.
- When the feed list is refreshed, ensure the cursor stays on the currently selected feed.

## Marking a feed as "problematic"
- Pressing the `d` key will mark a feed as problematic by sending a POST request to 
  the Podcast Index API endpoint: 'https://api.podcastindex.org/api/1.0/report/problematic'.  
  The call to the '/report/problematic' endpoint should contain the feed ID as a url 
  parameter called `id`.  This endpoint requires an API key and secret from 
  the `pimonitor.yaml` configuration file.
- If the call to the '/report/problematic' endpoint fails, print an error message to the console.
- If the call to the '/report/problematic' endpoint succeeds, refresh the feed list by polling the new/recent feeds endpoint again.
- Upon pressing the `d` key, pop open a small dialog box asking the user to select a reason for marking the feed as problematic.  The user should be able to select one of the following reasons:
  - `No Reason` translates to `reason` value of `0`
  - `Spam` translates to `reason` value of `1`
  - `AI Slop` translates to `reason` value of `2`
  - `Illegal Content` translates to `reason` value of `3`
  - `Duplicate` translates to `reason` value of `4`
  - `Malicious Payload` translates to `reason` value of `5`
  - `Feed Hijack` translates to `reason` value of `6`
- The `reason` value selected by the user should be sent as a url parameter called `reason` in the call to the '/report/problematic' endpoint.
- In the reason selection dialog box, the user should be able to select the reason by pressing the corresponding number key (0-6) or using the arrow keys to navigate and Enter to confirm.

## Unit testing
- When new functions are created, write a unit test for them.
- Run `cargo test`.  If any tests fail, fix them and rebuild.
- All tests should be created in the `tests` directory.

## AI/LLM coding
- When AI/LLM coding agents make changes, write a new datestamped file to the `.llm_history` directory outlining the changes made.
- The generated file should be added to the current commit.

## The `pimonitor.yaml` configuration file
- This is a YAML configuration file.
- If it does not exist upon startup, it will be created with blank values.
- It should be read right before each polling interval starts.
- It contains the following keys: `pi_api_key`, `pi_api_secret`, `poll_interval`
- The `poll_interval` key is optional. If not provided, the default polling interval is 60 seconds.  If this key is provided, it must be an integer greater than 30 seconds.  If it is not, the default polling interval will be used.  It's value should be stored in a global variable called `POLL_INTERVAL`.
- The `pi_api_key` and `pi_api_secret` hold the API key and secret for read/write operations on the Podcast Index API.
- If either the `pi_api_key` or `pi_api_secret` is missing a global variable should be set called `PI_READ_WRITE` with a value of `false`.
- If both the `pi_api_key` and `pi_api_secret` are present, the `PI_READ_WRITE` variable should be set to `true`.
