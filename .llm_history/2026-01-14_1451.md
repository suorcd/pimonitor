Change: Ensure temporary audio downloads are deleted on program exit

Date: 2026-01-14 14:51 (local)

Summary
- Implemented robust cleanup of any downloaded audio file when the app exits.

Details
- Previously, temporary audio files downloaded for playback were removed only when `stop_playback()` was called explicitly (e.g., when the user stopped playback). If the app exited directly from the UI loop, a leftover temp file could remain.
- Updated the shutdown path in `src/main.rs` so the UI loop now exits gracefully and `app.stop_playback()` is called before restoring the terminal and returning. This ensures the active sink/stream are dropped and any temp audio file (tracked via `AppState.temp_audio_path`) is deleted.
- Removed the `std::process::exit(0)` at the end of `main()` and return `Ok(())` instead to allow normal shutdown and cleanup.
- Note: Forced termination (e.g., OS-level kill) may still bypass cleanup, but standard in‑app exit (`q`) and normal loop termination will clean up files.

Touched files
- src/main.rs

User-facing impact
- Temporary audio files no longer linger after the program exits normally; disk space is preserved and temp directories remain clean.
