### Changes on 2026-01-09 16:06

- Implemented AGENTS.md requirement for Podcast Index polling parameters.
- Updated `src\main.rs` in function `pi_get_recent_newfeeds()` to include both:
  - `since` = current UTC time minus 86,400 seconds (24 hours), as a Unix timestamp.
  - `max` = 500 to limit page size as specified.

Details:
```
GET https://api.podcastindex.org/api/1.0/recent/newfeeds
  ? since=<unix_timestamp_seconds>
  & max=500
```

Notes:
- No new functions were introduced; therefore no new unit tests were required per Unit testing policy.
- Attempted `cargo build`, but the build failed due to the executable being locked by the OS (likely currently running):
  "failed to remove file target\debug\pimonitor.exe (os error 5)".
  Please ensure no running instance of `pimonitor.exe` exists and rebuild with `cargo build`.
