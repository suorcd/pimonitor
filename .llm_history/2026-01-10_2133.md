# Playback Auto-stop Implementation

**Date:** 2026-01-10

## Summary
Fixed a bug where the playback counter continued to increment after the audio track finished playing.

## Changes
- **Modified UI Loop (`src/main.rs`)**: Added logic to check if the audio sink is empty (indicating playback completion) inside the main event loop.
- **Auto-Stop Logic**: If playback has finished naturally, `app.stop_playback()` is called automatically. This clears the "Playing" status and effectively stops the counter.

## Rationale
Previously, the application only tracked elapsed time from `playback_start` without checking if the track had actually finished, leading to the counter running indefinitely.
