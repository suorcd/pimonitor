### 2026-01-30 – Vim mode enhancements, quit fix, and flagged feed styling

Changes made:

- **Fixed quit behavior** (`src/main.rs`):
  - `q` key now exits immediately from anywhere, including modals (search, reason selection, details, XML viewer)
  - Added shutdown channel (`shutdown_tx`/`shutdown_rx`) to signal background polling task to terminate
  - Uses `std::process::exit(0)` after cleanup to ensure immediate termination (background tasks were blocking exit)

- **Enhanced vim mode navigation** (`src/main.rs`):
  - Added `g/G` for jump to top/bottom of list
  - Added `0/$` for jump to start/end of list
  - Added `Ctrl-u/Ctrl-d` for half-page scroll up/down
  - All motions work in both list view and modals (XML viewer, details popup)
  - Updated help modal (`?`) to document all vim keybindings

- **Removed strike-through from flagged feeds** (`src/main.rs`):
  - Flagged feeds now show `[FLAG reason]` label in red but no longer have `CROSSED_OUT` modifier
  - Both title line and link line display without strike-through styling

- **Rewrote AGENTS.md**:
  - Expanded from ~53 to ~112 lines with comprehensive agent guidance
  - Added build/test commands, coding style, vim mode documentation
  - Documented configuration rules, polling behavior, search, and reporting features
