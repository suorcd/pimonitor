# Vim Keys in Problematic Report Modal

**Date:** 2026-01-10

## Summary
Fixed an inconsistency where the "Report Problematic" submenu (invoked by `d`) did not support Vim navigation keys or list them in the UI when the application was running in Vim mode.

## Changes
- **UI Update (`src/main.rs`)**: The title of the reason selection modal now includes "j/k=nav" when `vim_mode` is active.
- **Input Handling (`src/main.rs`)**: Added event handlers for `j` and `k` within the modal context to map to Down and Up navigation respectively, mirroring standard Vim behavior.

## Rationale
Ensures a consistent keyboard-driven experience for users opting into the Vim control scheme, preventing the need to switch back to arrow keys for specific submenus.
