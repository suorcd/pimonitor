### Changes on 2026-01-09 16:27

- Implemented `d` key functionality to mark a feed as problematic per AGENTS.md.
- Added POST call to Podcast Index endpoint `https://api.podcastindex.org/api/1.0/report/problematic` with `id` query param and proper headers.
- Credentials are read from `pimonitor.yaml`; action is only enabled when both `pi_api_key` and `pi_api_secret` are present (`PI_READ_WRITE = true`).
- UI: Pressing `d` on a selected feed will trigger the report; status messages indicate success or failure.
- Added helpers to compute PodcastIndex auth headers and to load creds.
- Added new dependency: `sha1 = "0.10"`.
- Created test file `tests/pi_problematic.rs` with unit tests for the helper functions.
- Created `src/lib.rs` exposing helpers `build_pi_auth_headers` and `load_pi_creds_from` for testing.

Files modified/added:
- Cargo.toml (added `sha1` dependency)
- src/main.rs (key handling, API helpers, UI status messages)
- src/lib.rs (new)
- tests/pi_problematic.rs (new)
- .llm_history/2026-01-09_1627.md (this file)

Notes:
- On Windows, `cargo test` may fail to remove `pimonitor.exe` if the app is currently running. Close it before running tests.
