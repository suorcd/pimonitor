# Playback Duration Indicator in Vim Mode

**Date:** 2026-01-10

## Summary
Added a feature to display the total duration of the playing track in the status bar, gated behind the `--vim` flag.

## Changes
- **Updated `AppState` in `src/main.rs`:** Added `playing_duration` field to store track length.
- **New Helper:** Implemented `get_duration_from_file` using `symphonia` to probe audio file duration metadata.
- **Rendering Logic:** Updated status bar drawing to append ` / MM:SS` to the playback timer if `vim_mode` is enabled.
- **Logic Flow:** Playback duration is calculated in `UiMsg::PlayReady` handler only if `vim_mode` is active to respect user flag preferences and optimize slightly.
