Summary
- Implemented AGENTS.md requirements for polling, filtering, and reporting problematic feeds.

Details
1. Polling adjustments
   - src/main.rs: pi_get_recent_newfeeds() now sends `since` (now-86400) and `max=500` query parameters.
   - Filters out any feeds where the `dead` field is truthy (true/1/"true").

2. Problematic reporting UI and API
   - Added a reason selection modal invoked by pressing `d`.
   - Reasons and codes per AGENTS.md: No Reason=0, Spam=1, AI Slop=2, Illegal Content=3, Duplicate=4, Malicious Payload=5, Feed Hijack=6.
   - On Enter: calls Podcast Index `/report/problematic` with `id` and `reason`, using auth headers.
   - On success: refreshes feed list by calling the polling function again.
   - On failure: prints an error to stderr and updates status in UI.

3. Config requirements (from AGENTS.md)
   - Existing code ensures `pimonitor.yaml` is created if missing with blank values.
   - Reads YAML before each interval, sets global `POLL_INTERVAL` (default 60; only >30 accepted) and `PI_READ_WRITE` based on presence of both key and secret.

4. Library helpers
   - src/lib.rs: Added public helpers `reason_options()` and `reason_code_for_index()` for the UI mapping.
   - Kept `build_pi_auth_headers` and `load_pi_creds_from` public for tests and reuse.

5. Tests
   - tests/reasons.rs: Tests reason options and mapping; verifies auth header generation for a known timestamp.
