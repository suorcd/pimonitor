Changes:
- Added local tracking of flagged feeds and render them with a flag label plus reason before the ID, keeping them visible.
- Applied strike-through styling to flagged feed rows to indicate they were reported without removing them.
- Persist flag reason immediately when reports succeed via UI message and keep all other UI behaviors intact.

Tests:
- cargo test
