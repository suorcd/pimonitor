Changes:
- Fixed flagged feeds disappearing on refresh: flagged feeds are now preserved in the feed list even when the API no longer returns them.
- Captures copies of flagged feeds before applying new API data, then re-adds them if they're missing from the fresh response.
- Strike-through and flag label now persist across refreshes.

Tests:
- cargo test
