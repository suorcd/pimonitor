### Changes on 2026-01-09 19:36

- Implemented AGENTS.md update to support selecting a reason when reporting a feed as problematic.
- UI: Pressing `d` now opens a modal dialog to choose one of the reasons: Dead=0, Spam=1, Slop=2, Illegal=3, Duplicate=4, Malicious=5.
- Navigation: Up/Down to move, Enter to confirm, Esc to cancel.
- Added new `AppState` fields to manage the reason selection modal.
- API: Updated `pi_report_problematic` to accept a `reason` parameter and include it as a `reason` query parameter in the POST to `/api/1.0/report/problematic`.
- After successful report, the app refreshes the recent/new feeds; on error, a status message is shown.
- Built with `cargo build`: success.
