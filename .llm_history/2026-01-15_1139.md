### 2026-01-15 – Implemented "Searching for a feed" feature

Changes made:

- Added a reusable search helper in `src/lib.rs`:
  - `find_feed_index_by_query(feeds: &[(u64, T)], query: &str) -> Option<usize>`
  - Behavior per AGENTS.md:
    - If the query is a positive integer, treat as feed ID and match by `id`.
    - Otherwise, split into words and require all words (case-insensitive substrings) to be present in the title.
    - Empty query yields no result (caller does nothing on Enter).

- Integrated a Search modal into the TUI in `src/main.rs`:
  - New `AppState` fields: `search_modal: bool`, `search_input: String`.
  - Pressing `s` opens a small dialog to type the search term.
  - Pressing `Enter` performs the search; jumps selection to the first match.
  - If no match is found, prints an error via `eprintln!` and keeps the dialog open.
  - `Esc` cancels. `Backspace` deletes last character.
  - Empty input + Enter does nothing, per spec.
  - The help modal now lists `s` for Search.

- Unit tests added in `tests/test_search.rs` covering:
  - Empty/whitespace query (no action)
  - Numeric ID search (present and absent IDs)
  - Word-conjunction matching and case-insensitive substring behavior
  - Zero/negative numeric strings not treated as ID

Notes:
- Running `cargo test` on Windows may fail if `pimonitor.exe` is currently running because Cargo cannot replace the binary (Access is denied, os error 5). Close any running instance of the app and re-run the tests.
