Changes made on 2026-01-09 20:14

Summary
- Implemented new AGENTS.md requirement: allow selecting a problematic-report reason using number keys (0-6) in the modal, in addition to arrow keys + Enter.

Details
1. UI input handling
   - src/main.rs: In the reason selection modal, added handling for `KeyCode::Char('0'..'6')`.
   - Pressing a number immediately selects the corresponding reason index and submits the report, mirroring the Enter flow.
   - Still supports Up/Down navigation and Enter to confirm, and Esc to cancel.

2. No API changes
   - Continues to call Podcast Index `/report/problematic` with `id` and `reason`.
   - On success: refreshes the feed list; on failure: logs error and updates status.

Files touched
- src/main.rs
- .llm_history/2026-01-09_2014.md (new)

Notes
- Attempted to run `cargo test`, but Windows reported the target executable was in use (Access is denied). If tests are required, please close any running instance of the app and re-run `cargo test`.
